Installation

Open package contents into a directory.

Run 'make' in that directory.  You need a C++ compiler that supports C++11.

Ensure that commands 'rocker' and 'shaep' are on the path.

You can have brutenib.sh's location on PATH, set alias to the script, etc.

Usage

Make a working directory.  Call the 'brutenib.sh' in that directory.
It will show what options are required.
